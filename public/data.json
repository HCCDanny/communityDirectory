    "description": "Hull Parent Carer Forum is a community of interest company based in Hull for parents and carers of children and young people aged 0-25 with special educational needs, disabilities, other neurodiverse conditions including mental health difficulties. All of our directors/steering group members and parent representatives are parents of children with SEND.  We are part funded by the DFE and the ICB to gather feedback from parents and carers about their experiences of the services and systems across the city of Hull. Our parent representatives then use this feedback when strategically working alongside services including Health, Social care and Education with the aim to inform decisions made within services being delivered.   In addition to this we also offer opportunities for parent carers to come together at our regular breakfast and lunch clubs and coffee and chat sessions,  where we share experiences and information with other parents and carers  in order to be able to help them navigate the services and support they are entitled to.   We as parent carers representative and with the use of the experience of our wider forum members empower parents by signposting each other to information, organisations and services to understand their rights and the rights of their children and   By listening to our members experiences we identify gaps within the support local area, listen to their needs and challenges they may be facing in their lives as SEND parents, and support them by facilitating workshops, activities and events both face to face and online that will help them strengthen their knowledge and skills, enable them to feel confident they have the tools to manage their day to day life and look after their own wellbeing as a parent and carer.   At all of our events, we provide a safe space for our members to share their experiences and feelings, receive peer support from each other and develop important relationships in a non judgmental atmosphere.",

We are here to support people who have vulnerability, and to empower these individuals to optimise their lives and create, dignity, independence, social inclusionand choice within their own environment that is specific to their needs.",

    "description": "The question of care at home doesn't usually come up until there's a sudden unexpected need for it. For most people they only have two options, either living without help, or going into a residential home. There is however a third option of having a qualified carer visit your house, to provide help and assistance with day to day activities in the comfort of your own home.  Most of our home care visits range from 30-60mins, but there is no maximum limit to how long a call can last, should longer calls be needed for assistance.  The quality of care, application and support provided by our dedicated and professionally qualified and trained Care Staff is outstanding. We have invested heavily into our call monitoring systems ensuring we have a close eye on all our clients.",
